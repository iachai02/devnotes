# All DSA concepts with problems

## Arrays

- 1. Duplicate Values (easy)
  - use hashset
  - loop through the array and add the number to the hashset if not in the hashset
  - check if number is in hashset and if it is, return true
  - if not, return false
  - Time: O(n)
- 2. Missing Number (easy)
  - get the range of the length of nums array + 1 and get the sum of that
  - subtract that number with the sum of the nums array to get the missing value
  - Time: O(n)
- 3. Find All Missing Numbers (easy)
  - when thinking about duplicates, think about sets
  - sets in python are unordered
  - loop through from 1 to n and check if that number is in the set
    - if it is not in the set, add that number to array
  - return the array which holds the numbers that are missing in the set
  - Time: O(n)
- 4. Two Sum (easy)
  - use a hashmap (dictionary)
  - iterate through the array and add the number with the position to a hashmap while checking if the target - the number is already in the hashmap
  - if the target - the number is in the hashmap, return the indicies at the current pointer and the index where the value is in the hashmap
  - Time: O(n)
- 5. How many numbers are smaller than? (easy)
  - start off by sorting the list
  - create an empty dictionary
  - loop through the enumerated sorted list
  - create an empty array for the return values
  - loop through the original list and append the value at the key
  - Time: O(nlogn)
- 6. Minimum Time Visiting All Points (easy)
  - distance between two points is max difference of one coordinate
  - i.e. if the next node is +10x and -5y, then it's going to take exactly 10 steps (seconds) because you can only move 1x at a time
  - have a res variable to keep track of the amount of seconds
  - pop off the first point from the points array given
  - iterate through all the points in the array
    - pop off the next point
    - add the max difference between the x and y coordinates of both points to the res variable
  - Time: O(n)
- 7. Spiral Matrix (med)
  - have a res array variable that will return the numbers in a spiral
  - use a while loop to go through the entire matrix
    - first pop off the first row of the matrix and add to res
    - if there are values in the matrix and the first list in the matrix is truthy
      - iterate through each row and pop out the last element in order and add to res
    - if there are values in the matrix, add the reverse of the last row to res and pop it off
    - if there are values in the matrix and the first list in the matrix is truthy
      - iterate through each row in reverse and pop off the elements in order to the res array
  - Time: O(n)
- 8. Number of Islands (med)
  - use breadth-first search
  - first check for grid
    - return 0 if no grid
  - keep track of the length of rows and columns as well as an empty set for visited
  - iterate through the rows and columns
    - checks if at the position = "1" and not visited
      - use bfs at that position
      - this would check for the position above it, to the right, to the left, and below it
      - everytime it does so, it will mark it as visited and add to the queue and continually pop off the queue until there is no coordinates left
    - adds to count indicating one island
  - Time: O(m\*n)

### Two-pointers

- 1. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (easy)
  - have a left and right pointer at the first index and second index
  - go through a while loop while not at the end of the list
  - check if the prices at left is less than price at right
    - calculate profit and compare that profit to the max profit
  - make left = right if above is not true
  - add one to right
  - Time: O(n)
