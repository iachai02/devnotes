# Sliding Window

- maintains a window of elements in the data dynamically adjusting the size
- uses two pointers as well but the first pointer is used for the start of the window and the other pointer is used for the end of the window
- the window slides as the end pointer moves
- very useful for problems required to continuous sequences
  - often combined with hashmaps to keep track of elements within the window
