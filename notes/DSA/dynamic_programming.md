# Dynamic Programming

- top-down
  - start from the main problem and recursively solve the sub-problems and storing the results of the subproblems
  - backtracking + memoization
- bottom-up
  - solve the smallest sub-problems first and use the solutions to build up the larger problem
  - filling out a table where each entry represents a solution to a smaller subproblem
